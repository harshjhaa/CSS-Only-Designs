      <h1 class="title">King Cobra</h1>
      <p>
        The king cobra was described and drawn by the Danish naturalist Theodore
        Edward Cantor in 1836, who gave it the scientific name Hamadryas hannah.
        Cantor had three specimens from the Sundarbans and one caught in the
        vicinity of Kolkata. It was subordinated to the genus Ophiophagus by
        Albert Günther in 1864.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ophiophagus hannah belongs to the monotypic genus Ophiophagus in the
        family Elapidae, while most other cobras are members of the genus Naja.
        They can be distinguished from other cobras by size and hood. King
        cobras are generally larger than other cobras, and the stripe on the
        neck is a chevron instead of a double or single eye shape that may be
        seen in most of the other Asian cobras. Moreover, the hood of the king
        cobra is narrower and longer. A key to identification, clearly visible
        on the head, is the presence of a pair of large scales known as
        occipitals, located at the back of the top of the head. These are behind
        the usual "nine-plate" arrangement typical of colubrids and elapids, and
        are unique to the king cobra.

      <h1 class="title">Swan</h1>
      <p>
        Swans are birds of the family Anatidae within the genus Cygnus. The
        swans' close relatives include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped
        with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they
        form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct
        subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or seven living (and one extinct)
        species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition, there is another
        species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no longer
        considered one of the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, although
        “divorce” sometimes occurs, particularly following nesting failure, and
        if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. The number
        of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight.
